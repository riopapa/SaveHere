With this application, you can memorize where you were. 

It saves current position into Camera folder as screen shot, so that you may refer the place later.

Information in screen shots are
- google map place and address or your text input, e.g. place name, shop name,.. to remember
- GPS coordinates ()
- screen shot date and time (local time)

This application is for those who travels around the world and wants to record where he/she was. By capturing you can review photo with screen shot in time sequenced between photos.

## Permission Required

- WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (save captured image)
- ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION (get GPS information)
For simplicity, I did not fully implement the following permission process

These permission should be applied by yourself.

## Source in github
